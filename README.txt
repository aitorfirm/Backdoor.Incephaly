                          Incefalia

Incefalia is the dominant purpose Trojan, originating in 2003, 
Its capacity reflects the originality, but above all the 
mentality of being able to access outside the physical disk.
Due to its Spanish origin, this malware infiltrates the 32-64
bit BIOS firmware. Created in assembly, and C, (recreated)

Incephaly is not modern, only runs on non-UEFI hardware.

Incefalia requires 512 Meg of RAM minimum.

Incefalia may require you to enter the addresses of the I/O ports
of your CD/DVD drive and hard drive. On Windows, you can find the
I/O port information in Accessories/System Tools/System 
Information/Hardware Resources/I/O Ports. Look for and write
down the "IDE", "ATA", or "SATA" port numbers. On Linux, use "lspci -v".
Then, boot the compiled ISO CD of the Trojan, mount it on your machine
as a VM installation. important notice notice notice notice
(Since it's an assembly installation, you can't use an .exe file, asshole.)
